  content: "Hiya!\nWelcome to my blog. Each month (timeframe not exact) I'll be posting up a topic that interests me. It may be related to software development, it may be talking about my plans for the future, it may be my personal opinion on current topics and trends. Whatever it may be, I hope you find it entertaining / informative / useful / funny ...\nI'll be honest. there's nothing in this blog. It just felt so naked putting my first personal website up without a single post in the blog. I am currently working on a piece detailing my experiences working with the react on rails gem (which you can see here: github.com/shakacode/react_on_rails) that I used in the creation of this website. Check back within the month (tm) to see the piece."
