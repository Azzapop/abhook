First up, the portfolio, abhook.id.au/portfolio, where you can see the projects that I'm proud to have worked on, as well check out some of the awesome events I've been a part of.\nMoving on, we make our way over to the contact page, at abhook.id.au, need some software development done, have a question for me, just want to say hi? Drop me a message here and I'll be sure to get it.\nOur last stop on this tour is the blog, abhook.id.au/blog, where you can do a bit of light reading and find out what I've been thinking lately. What's that? There's nothing here? That's because I just started, stick around and there'll soon be more. I can't guarentee when, but they'll appear eventually.\nThank you for joining me on this brief tour, I take no responsibility for any wasted time you may have experienced, or side effects that you may incur."
