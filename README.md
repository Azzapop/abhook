### [abhook.id.au](abhook.id.au)
Code repository for my personal website. This site was built on rails, using the [React on Rails gem](https://github.com/shakacode/react_on_rails) to create React components for front-end use. Check-out their amazing docs for more info.


##### Tests
Testing is done using rspec. Check the spec folder for all tests. Run the tests using `bundle exec rspec`.


Files and the server are hosted on AWS.


##### Deployment
Mental Note, look into an integration service.

##### Feedback
For feedback, pop me an email or head over to [my website](abhook.id.au/contact) and leave me some constructive criticism.
